        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Nice to meet you. Currently, I am a student at the College of Engineering within the 
            University of Michigan. I'm part way through my second year here, working towards a 
            BSE in Computer Science and a Minor in Business Administration. I created this website
            as a side project, aiming for it to serve as a portfolio representing my work.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a Michigan native, an avid rock climber, and am really good at Rocket League. I've
            learned that I enjoy people, engineering, and the thrill of an occasional coding sprint.
            <br>
            <br>
            Feel free to check out some of my projects below!
