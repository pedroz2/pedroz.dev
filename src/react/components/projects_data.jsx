          description: 'The Piazza Post Classifier took in a large number of forum posts from Piazza and used natural language processing with a dataset of prelabeled Piazza posts to generate connections between common keywords and their labels. Further posts can be entered into the program which then returns its prediction on the suggested topic the classifier thinks the post is from. I enjoyed this project as it was my first introduction to big data and using machine learning techniques to process and use that data. It was a neat project that had a satisfying result.',

Modern calculaters do that in reverse - for example, 1+2-3 would be 1,2+3- in the RPN calculator. This project was a cool way of demonstrating and learning the stack data structure, which we also made by creating a wrapper on the C++ vector library.',

It would then return the most optimal braking coefficient - one that would use up as much of the runway as possible to reduce passenger discomfort, but also still result in a safe landing. The purpose of this project was to get a grasp on using a program to help solve complex math and physics problems - it worked pretty well.',

RPS-101 had 5,050 different outcomes and just under a one percent chance of a tie - it was easily the move convoluted game I\'ve ever programmed. You can find more \'normal\' versions too, like RPS-15 and RPS-25 (I actually programmed those first and that\'s what led me to RPS-101). The funny thing is, I technically don\'t even know if it is bug-free because I never tested all 5050 outcomes.',

There are many techniques that were ready to be implemented depending on your dedication - stuff like priority selection of enemy robots, leading targets for more accurate shots, and randomized movement if another robot is aiming at you. You could make your robot have some personality as well - I know a few people who made their robot drive in circles, waiting until one person got close enough before it relentlessly chased them down with melee attacks. It was a pretty cool project that introducted me to using libraries and frameworks in your program.',
