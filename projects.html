<p>This project is probably my favorite to date. The final report turned out <em>wonderfully</em>.</p>

<p>This semester-long, 5 person project went from learning the basics of electrical wiring and soldering to launching a fully operational and to-specification atmospheric weather balloon. Our group elected to include two extra sensors, the MPU-9250 Gyroscope/Accelerometer and the BMP-280 Barometer, in hopes of simultaneously measuring accerelation and altitude. With these two sensors, we were able to deduce wind shearing forces at different altitudes throughout Earth’s atmosphere. The intended real world application of this was to record the expected turbulance experienced by commerical airliners, and more specifically, how to avoid it. We used Altium to design a custom PCB, which we then had printed to allow for a permanent board with which we can solder our core sensors to. In order to facilitate the use of our sensors in harmony, we created an C++ library to use them more efficiently - it actually won one of the class awards.</p>

<p>I started this project as a direct answer to one of my daily problems, and it actually turned out pretty well. I did a few weeks of research (mostly Youtube Tutorials) and decided to start in the summer, right before school started. For me, the hardest part was actually creating a frame that would fit the mirror since I had no previous experience with wood working. After that, I was able to connect everything up a set up a Raspberry PI server that I could remote into and install the Magic Mirror framework. I spent about a month configuring this huge JavaScript library, even using some third-party code (specifically for the calendar), and tried to get everything to my liking. I am pretty proud of the result. I can finally see the weather, date, and whatever I have to do that day in the mirror! </p>

<p>This was a fun project that started out as a way to further develop my front-end skills and ended as a moderate obsession. I am pretty proud with how it turned out, it actually looks pretty professional given the expectations I had going into this project. It started out as a React template website, then I started using Hugo as a static-site generator. I found the themes system in Hugo to be too much of a hassle so I switched to Jekyll in hopes of remedying that (it didn't). I gave up on trying to use somebody else's theme and finally made my own. Now I have this Jekyll/HTML/CSS hybrid-frankenstein website that uses my version of <a href="https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec">EECS485's Project Specification theme</a>. I tailored the base of the theme to my website, but still kept the same basic design in hopes of making my project specification's easier to read.</p>

<p>This project was a deep dive on specific data structures, specifically the stack and queue. It actually uses a deque (double-ended queue), but we wrapped it such that it only had stack/queue functionality. In summary, we were given a 2D 100x100 grid of a treasure map with land, water, obstructions, and the treasure. Our task was to find the treasure coordinate and more importantly, the correctly path to that coordinate depending on the search mode used (Stack vs. Queue searching strategies). This was my first project you couldn't just code in one sitting - you needed to actually plan and think about the correct Data Structures to use for each part of the program.</p>

<p><em>C++.</em></p>

<img src="/assets/logmanager.jpg" alt="Log Manager" title="Log Manager" style="max-width:70%">
<br>
<p>This project consisted of a user inputting a <em>huge</em> file of logs. Our task was to organize and index it, then allow the user to perform a handle of commands (such as print, sort, keyword search, time search, etc) to output a text file with only the logs they want. The main learning goal of this project was to understand time complexities of different data structures and algorithms, as we had to fit all of the commands given within their relevant time allotment to pass the test. </p>

<p>This project was aimed to reinforce the usage of path finding algorithms like Djikstra, Kruskal, and Prims, as well as reinforce the usage of more advanced programming techniques like Branch and Bound, Backtracing, and Dynamic Programming. We were given coordinates in a 2d map and had to find things such as the minimum spanning tree (shortest path) between two points, the most optimal path between all points with a given heuristic (for this project, we used nearest arbitrary insertion), and a moderately optimal path in a much faster time.  </p>

<p>When I first looked back at my old website to add it to this portfolio, the first thing I thought was "I remember this looking better". It was my first introduction to anything relevant to programming (if you consider HTML a programming language). I made it watching some YouTube tutorials when I was first learning to code. It's not anything fancy (quite the opposite, actually), but it got the job done. It uses a simple container-based styling and I remember being pretty happy with it when I finished. Who knows why FC Barcelona haven't given me a contract yet?  </p>
