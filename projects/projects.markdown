Project Documentation
=======================

[pedroz.dev](https://pedroz.dev/)

This is where you can find documentation on most of my projects. They are in chronological order, with my most recent projects at the beginning. You can use the sidebar table of contents for easy navigation.

Thanks for reading,

Pedro

Acknowledgements
----------------------
This documentation uses [Primer Spec](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec), a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) theme created by the UM's EECS485 staff. It was designed specifically for long project documentation and is based on the original Github Primer theme. My website landing page, [pedroz.dev](https://pedroz.dev/), runs on a heavily edited version of HTML5UP's [Photon](https://html5up.net/photon) theme.

Thanks for reading through my work. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
