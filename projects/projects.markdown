This project is probably my favorite project to date. I am _very_ proud of the final report.

This semester-long, 5 person project went from learning the basics of electrical wiring and soldering to launching a fully operational and to-specification atmospheric weather balloon. We used Altium to design a custom PCB, which we then had printed to allow for a permanent board with which we can solder our sensors to. In order to facilitate the use of our sensors in harmony, we created an C++ library to use them more easily - it won one of the class awards. Our group elected to include two extra sensors, the MPU-9250 Gyro/Accelerometer/Compass and the BMP-280 Barometer, in hopes of simultaneously measuring accerelation and altitude. With these two sensors, we were able to deduce wind shearing forces at different altitudes throughout Earth's atmosphere. The intended real world application of this was to record the expected turbulance experienced by commerical airliners, and more specifically, how to avoid it.

This documentation uses my version of [Primer Spec](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec), a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) theme created by the UM's EECS485 staff. It was designed specifically for long project documentation and is based on the original Github Primer theme. My website landing page, [pedroz.dev](https://pedroz.dev/), runs on a heavily edited version of HTML5UP's [Photon](https://html5up.net/photon) theme.
